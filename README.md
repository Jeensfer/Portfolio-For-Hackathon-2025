# 🚗 Smart AGV Simulator

**Intelligent Automation • Hackathon 2025**

An interactive simulation demonstrating how Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) navigate warehouse environments using real-time obstacle detection and dynamic path planning.

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **Portfolio Page**: [View Portfolio](https://yourusername.github.io/agv-simulator/portfolio.html)
- **Live Simulator**: [Launch Simulator](https://yourusername.github.io/agv-simulator/)

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ Interactive 2D grid-based warehouse environment
- 🤖 Smart AGV agent with smooth animations
- 🧠 A* pathfinding algorithm for optimal routes
- 🛡️ Static obstacle avoidance
- ⚡ Dynamic obstacle detection and rerouting
- 📊 Real-time path visualization

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5 Canvas** - High-performance 2D rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Pure ES6+ for algorithms
- **Modern CSS3** - Advanced styling and animations
- **A* Algorithm** - Industry-standard pathfinding

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `portfolio.html` for the project overview
3. Open `index.html` to launch the simulator
4. Click to place obstacles and watch the AGV navigate!

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Set Start & Destination** - Define where the AGV begins and ends
2. **Place Obstacles** - Add warehouse elements like walls and shelves
3. **Calculate Path** - A* algorithm finds the shortest safe route
4. **Watch Navigation** - AGV travels along the optimal path
5. **Add Dynamic Obstacles** - Place new obstacles during movement
6. **Adaptive Rerouting** - AGV recalculates and continues safely

## 🎯 Real-World Impact

This simulation demonstrates core technology used by industry leaders like Amazon, Alibaba, and DHL for warehouse automation:

- **40% faster operations** through optimal routing
- **24/7 autonomous work** without human intervention
- **99.9% accuracy rate** in navigation and delivery
